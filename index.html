                    Whether we be meeting with sales reps or a small business owner, this topic is something we address on almost a daily basis. These individuals simply want to increase small business sales; however, they are not necessarily familiar with the foundations of online sales.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, you're reading this because you want an answer just like them, however I have no way of gauging your experience on this matter, so this article will offer answers that newbies can understand, while hopefully not offending you if you're more knowledgable.

                    Increase Small Business Sales
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, let's ask a question: How do small businesses make sales?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Good question, and one we should address upfront. Decades ago, any business that wanted to increase small business sales simply went hunting for their next potential customer by knocking on doors, trying to get past the secretary on the telephone, and even standing on the corner handing out brochures and flyers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These days, as we talk to these same businesses, we see that some are still stuck in their old ways, doing the above-mentioned actions, HOPING their sales reps can close a few more sales each day; and others have welcomed the online world we now live in, and the opportunities it presents, resulting in online sales that occur 24/7.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Seeing as how you are here reading an article called "Get More traffic to your website", I am going to surmise that you are in the latter group, and that your marketing strategy already incorporates the internet, or at least will do shortly. So, let's look at what avenues you have available to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When first starting out online, a website is not always necessary, HOWEVER having a way to connect with your target audience is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why would you want to understand your target Audience? Primarily to ensure you are attracting the relevant type of client, not tyre kickers or uninterested parties, which in turn increases your conversions. Once you know who the "right" people are, you can begin creating, or curating, content for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A good place to act on your content marketing strategy is Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and YouTube are the core social platforms to look at, and by simply posting content that a potential customer (and existing customers) would be interested in, you will find that your brand will become more widely known. Your target Audience will like your posts, sharing them with their own circles, which indirectly increases your circle of influence. We cover Social Media Management in another article so we won't dig too deep here, but I will expand upon understanding your target audience.

                    How do I determine my Target Audience
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are already in business and getting sales, then you have already uncovered members of your target audience, as they have been buying off you. Is this your IDEAL target audience? We shall discuss this a little to give you some guidance, and list some key points to consider below, however we cover this in more detail in our "Who is my ideal client" article.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The great thing to know is that your target audience is looking for you too, so creating a strategy to connect with them is a wise business move.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key things to consider when determining your ideal client are:
                </p>
                <b>
                    Who has problems that your product/service can solve?
                </b>
                <br>
                <b>
                    What segment consistently buys from your business already?
                </b>
                <br>
                <b>
                    Which competitors are currently taking business from you, and what type of client are they attracting?
                </b>
                <br>
                <b>
                    Why are these buyers attracted to your competitor and not you?
                </b>
                <br>
                <b>
                    Which of the above customer bases will offer you the least resistance, highest satisfaction rating, and best profit margin?
                </b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Once you know the above and have decided upon the type of client you want to deal with, it is time to create your content marketing strategy.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When this strategy is implemented correctly, you have the capability of creating a customer following that you can then communicate with via posts and promotions.
                </p>

                    Now, caution must be used with social media platforms these days. As of recent, we have seen the Terms of Service for many Social Media Platforms modified to allow immediate execution of accounts, and the implementation of filtering on posts and content shared.

                </p>
                <p>
                    It means that while Social Media is an incredible resource for gathering names, and a great way to educate your audience, increasing brand awareness, it is wise to redirect your clients to a promotion OFF social media that allows you to capture their contact details (email, phone number, location, etc) so that when (if) your Social Media account inexplicably shuts down, you still have your customers details to continue communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, how do we do this?
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a couple of ways, and this brings us back to the main title of this article - create a website, even just a basic one that captures the above details. Let’s discuss our options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A great option could be to Offer a Discount or bonus via an opt-in form. Or possibly a "keep in touch with us for latest news" newsletter. Or even a questionnaire where they willingly join your mail-out list because they love your content so much. These opt-in forms can be done via a simple Auto Responder like Mailchimp, or via a one-page website (called a Sales Funnel) or even a multi-page website, which should be your end game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, now that you have a way of capturing your followers' contact details and you can market to them, the next step is to drive business to your website so that you can sell to them off your own platform. The question is how do you get this website traffic? Well, there are a few major ways this can be done.
                </p>

            <section style="background-color: white; padding: 20px; box-shadow: rgba(17, 17, 26, 0.1) 0px 8px 24px, rgba(17, 17, 26, 0.1) 0px 16px 56px, rgba(17, 17, 26, 0.1) 0px 24px 80px; padding: 30px; border-radius: 40px;">
                <p>
                    Direct Traffic
                </p>
                <p>
                    This simply means that you are driving traffic, or persuading shoppers to go to your website directly, by clicking a link, or following directions within an ad. This can be done at no cost, or it can be done at much cost - let's cover 2 in a little more detail.
                </p>
                <b>
                    Free Direct Traffic:
                </b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This is where you promote your business website in a post on social media or include the link to your site in text on a blog, an article, or simply in an email. The aim is to get that potential buyer to go directly to your website, or landing page, in as little moves as possible.
                </p>
                <b>
                    Paid Direct Traffic:
                </b>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Also known as ads, or Cost per click (CPC). This is where you pay every time someone sees or clicks your ad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These ads will be on the top of page 1 of Google if you use Google AdWords, or in the sidebar or newsfeed on Social Media, for e.g. A Facebook Ad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do they work in getting your business name/landing page/website in front of thousands of eyes? Absolutely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do they return a positive return on investment (ROI) - not always.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The upside to CPC is just that - hundreds to thousands of eyes seeing your business listing. The downside is that you cannot guarantee that every set of eyes to see your ad will result in a sale, or even a query.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You also cannot guarantee an interested party will even click your ad, because savvy buyers these days understand that these ads cost anywhere from $.50 to $100 per click, and that you have to make it back somehow...They're asking themselves "is that ad REALLY showing the best deal if the seller needs to cover the ad cost itself"?
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, WHY would someone use CPC if the ROI is not always positive? Rushed marketing? Poor advice? Desperation for sales NOW, regardless of the income earned? Honestly, sometimes the copyright and offer are so unique that the ad WILL work - this is a judgement call you need to make when planning your content marketing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Organic Traffic (FREE!!, or close to)
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is this voodoo magic? Website traffic for FREE? Welcome to Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). I know you have heard of these terms, but I don't know if you understand them, so let's go into a little detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a small business owner, you need to be savvy with your opportunities, your capital, and your time. You need to ensure your existing customers are looked after, remaining loyal; you need to keep working on getting that next new customer so that you can grow; and you need to make sure that when someone looks you up in their little search engine, you come up looking, and smelling, like roses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And much of this can be done using your social media profile, but it can be magnified 100-fold with Search Engine Optimisation, but...
                </p>

            <section>
                <p>
                    What is SEO?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, simply put, SEO is the act of optimising all the text, the images, the coding within your website to look interesting and relevant to your target audience, and if it does, then Google, Bing, Yahoo, YouTube, Duck Duck Go, and any other search engine will pop you up for said audience to look at. But how do we sort this SEO stuff out?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well first, we look at the search terms that your propective and existing buyers are hunting for, and we then incorporate this into the the website (Headers, metatags, geo tags, ALT text, descriptions, and more).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This sounds easy, and in the old days it really was - it was simply a case of punching those old keywords anywhere in the text on the site, over and over again, and then Google listed you first on their results page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These days however, Google penalises websites if this is done incorrectly, so take the time to research, develop and learn EVERYTHING you can about SEO before diving in head first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the above tweaks that can be made to your content, Search Engine Optimisation now also relies on Domain names, backlinks, page speed, how coherant a page is, and so on. Being a business owner though, you may or may not have the spare time to learn another speciality skill, so we recommend using an SEO expert when the need comes up (we start off as little as $495 a month for small business).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Does SEO give immediate results?
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many factors affecting the speed at which SEO results impact a website, inluding the age of the website, it's popularity, it's history and reputation, the quality and quantity of any website traffic, the competitors' websites, etc, but it is safe to say SEO will always work and it should be treated as "the long game".
                </p>
                <p>
                    That being said, we have ranked brand new websites on page 1 of Google in under 3 months, with some ranking for up to 10 major keywords in under 6. The website traffic seen on a website when it's on Page 1 is fantastic, but it is nothing like the traffic you will get when you're in the top 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You'll see what it's like, when you're in that position - Strap in.
